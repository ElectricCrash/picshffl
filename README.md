# TwitterAvatarCycle
Updates Twitter avatar selecting a random image from a folder

twitter.class.php is a library by David Grudl. It does not contain a function for updating your avatar.

As such, I've added that function and stripped the other API functions from the class.

Please see https://phpfashion.com/twitter-for-php for the original full class
